# Doran-Xna.Framework

Work in progess.

Partial port of MonoGame to Vala.

Based the partial classes that apply to SDL/OpenGL. 

The content pipeline is not ported over. In it's place I'm using Corange.

You'll need to install https://github.com/orangeduck/Corange to the same folder that contains the project using this package, so cmake can find the headers. You'll also need to make install Corange to the linker finds the library.
