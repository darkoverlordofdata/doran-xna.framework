# doran-xna.framework

A sort of a port of MonoGame to Vala.
The sort of refers to:

    No support for DirectX or iOS.
    Web support via emscripten
    Limited functionality
    Shaders (What shaders? ... I'm just learning)

ValaGame is primarily intended for use in emscripten. All design considerations favor emscripten. It works good on desktop (I consider that my preview mode), and should also run on arm - the predecessor runs on android, but this is not yet tested.
